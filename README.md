# ZFSWriteAmplificationTests
Tests for a Youtube video looking into ZFS write amplifaction

I ran these tests on a Proxmox system with different drive types with the goal of seeing if write amplifaction appears in ZFS. I think took the writes after different tests and processed them in a jupyter notebook with the gaol of analyzing the data and creating graphs.
